# codeforces-contests-solutions
Here, I try to post the solutions to codeforces contests.
This is updated after the contest.
For the questions I'm unable to solve in the contest, I try to do them after the contest and upload here. Otherwise, I look for references and hints and try to come up with a solution.
In near future, if I get time, will try to add hints and approaches as well.
I majorly use C++ and Python to solve the questions. If you want any specific solution in other language, please do let me know. Or feel free to update here in the contest folder with some other language/ some better approach or solution.
Please consider adding basic test cases also from the contest itself, since for CPP files there is a workflow which tests the code.
Test cases should be added in the file <Solution_File_Name>_test_cases.txt and expected outputs to be added in <Solution_File_Name>_expected_output.txt
Where, Solution_File_Name.cpp is the file name of your solution
